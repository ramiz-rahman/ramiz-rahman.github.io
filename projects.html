        <h2>Test Your Twtich</h2>
        <p class = "subheader">A simple JavaScript game that measures a person's reaction time.</p>
        <p><a href = "projects/Test_Your_Twitch/reaction_game.html" target = "_blank"><img src = "icons/chain.png" alt = "link to project website" title = "go to project website"> Test Your Twitch</a></p>
        <p>This is a simple game that measures the reaction time of the player. Upon pressing the start button, a shape will appear in the empty box and the player has to click on the shape as soon as possible. Every time (s)he clicks the shape, the time is taken to do so, aka his reaction time is measured. After ten clicks, the game ends and the player is shown some statistics, namely his best, worst and average reaction times.</p>
        <p>The web page that houses the game is written entirely in HTML and styled using CSS. The game mechanics is implemented using client-side JavaScript. There is no backend or a database connection.</p>
        <p>Both design and code for this project were done by me.</p>
