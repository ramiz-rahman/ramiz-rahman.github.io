      <h1>This is my story.</h1>
      <p>I’m Ramiz Rahman, an ambitious young lad from Dhaka, Bangladesh who is deeply in love with technology and startups. Currently I’m in the process of completing my undergrads, majoring in computer science and minoring in business administration. </p>
      <p>I am somewhat of an autodidact as I prefer to learn on my own rather than through a formal system. I taught myself web-development with the help of resources available on the internet and I now work as a freelance web developer. I developed an eye for detail with the help of books such as the ‘Universal Principles of Design’ and by analyzing the contents of the digital world. I spend a lot of time trying to learn new things and honing my existing skills with the help of MOOC providers such as edx.com and coursera.com. I have taken multiple courses on those platforms including the bootstrap course provided by Microsoft, and the public speaking course by the University of Washington.</p>
      <p>I have a deep interest in start-ups and I was lucky to have been able to work with one during its early days. Lamudi.com.bd is an online real estate and marketplace and joined the company as only the 5th employee during it’ second month of operation. This was in late 2013, a time before I had acquired my wed development skills and I joined as an intern responsible for data entry. However, life at Lamudi, as is the case for most young start-ups, was chaotic and I soon found myself working 10 hours a day on practically everything from lead generation to marketing to content creation to data-entry. My six month stint at the company taught me about what it really means to work at a start-up and gave me hands on experience with many facets of a business. Though working in a star-up is undeniably exhausting, it is also an environment in which I thrive and is justification for my dream of becoming a tech entrepreneur. </p>
      <p>I continuously keep on learning, not only about technology, but also about start-ups, marketing, sales, business administration, finance, design, etc. through books, videos and online courses. I have many interests aside from technology and start-ups and these include music (I am big fan of classic rock and heavy metal), anime (I grew up on them), video-games (particularly RPGs) and fashion (yup! I like to dress up when the occasion calls for it). Ultimately I’m an eternal optimist with a thirst for knowledge and a burning passion for realizing my big dreams. </p>
